# Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I started this bootcamp to one day become a Web Developer. I enjoy a challange, and keeping my brain active along with creating thing I can interact with. 
I built this project because it helps me familiarize with HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. Important building blocks to a pathway of learning much more, and how to properly build starting at a fondation and upwards.
It helped me solve structure issues I at times have.
I learned control flow, and also how to use git a little better. Still a work in progress!
